        <h1>Online Security </h1>
        <h7><i>By Michael Teixeira</i></h7>
        <hr>
        <div class="text-lg-left">
        <p>There are a number of things you can do to increase your security while
        using the internet, varying from basic security measures which should be
        practiced by everyone ideally, and extreme security measures which as you
        can guess are extremities that most people can do without.  We will stick
        with the former measures for now so that you may learn and or touch up on
        the very basic standards of security whilst using the internet.  Note that
        the drawback of increasing your online security generally means giving up on
        some convenience that is provided.  The choice is always yours.</p>



            <p>- Make sure you're using secure passwords wherever applicable, including
            on mobile devices.  You can go one step further here and save all your
            passwords in a secure password manager.  To check how secure a password
            is, click <a href="https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/">here!</a>
            </p>
            <p>- If you'd like to avoid being tracked, there a number of things you can do but
            the most basic method is by deleting your browsing history after every session.
            This includes cleaning out your cookies and cache.
            </p>
            <p>- A highly recommended security measure that anyone can take is installing a
                VPN (Virtual Private Network).  Easy to acquire and user friendly, VPNs are
                able to hide your identity from Internet Service Providers and anyone else that
                may be trying to track you.
            </p>
            <p>- Moderate your use of social media.  There are some key steps to take here such as
                to hide any real/personal information because once you put it out into the
                internet, it's free for anyone to access no matter what.  Avoid talking to
                strangers or just replying to strange/unknown messages, and this goes for
                emails as well.  And for mobile apps, disable unnecessary permissions, such as
                sharing locations, text messages, photos etc.
            </p>
            <p>- Avoid Javascript as much as you can, or completely disable it
                within your browser altogether. Javascript is important and can be
                considered the glue that keeps the Internet together, but it is
                also integral to the function of cookies.  Some recommended search
                engines that are alternatives to traditional search engines are
                StartPage, Duck Duck Go, and Firefox to name a few.

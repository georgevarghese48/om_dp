        <h1>Online Privacy Laws</h1>
        <h7><i>By Michael Teixeira</i></h7>
        <hr>

        <p>As technology advances and people become more skilled at using it for
        their own needs and desires, the potential for crime and breaches of online
        privacy increase drastically.  Although there is no single law that regulates
        online privacy and any crimes regarding it, there are a variety of federal
        and state laws that are trying to regulate what they can. </p>
        <p>Here are a few federal laws that are helping to regulate online privacy:
        </p>

        <div class="text-lg-left">
        <h6><i>The Federal Trade Commission Act</i></h6>
            <p>- In 1914, this law established the Federal Trade Commission (FTC),
            which is the main federal organization that regulates companies with
            regards to online privacy.  The Act was put into place to essentially
            outlaw unjust methods of competition and acts/practices that affect
            commerce.  Some actions that would trigger a violation of this act include
            failure to comply with clearly posted privacy policies and failure to properly
            protect any personal information that the company may be responsible
            for.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-lg-left">
            <h6><i>Electronic Communications Privacy Act</i></h6>
            <p>- In 1986, this law was enacted to protect various forms of
            communications by preventing unauthorized government access.  Some
            examples are wire taps of telephones, transmissions of electronic data
            through computer(s), and oral communications to name a few.  </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-lg-left">
            <h6><i>Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</i></h6>
            <p>- First enacted in 1986, this act has gone on to be amended a total of
            6 times.  With each amendment, the list of types of misconduct punishable
            under this act would grow to reflect the ever-growing field of technology in
            our modern world.  The computer-related activities made unlawful by this
            act consists of the unauthorized access to a computer with intentions of
            1) obtaining sensitive/valuable information, 2) defraud, and 3) to
            transmit anything harmful. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-lg-left">
            <h6><i>Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</i></h6>
            <p>- Also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999,
            the law was enacted in order to help regulate financial institutions
            in regards to the handling of personal information of clients. It also
            requires the institutions to provide customer notices and to have a
            written information security program in place. </p>

        <h1>How are you being tracked online?</h1>
        <h7><i>By Michael Teixeira</i></h7>
        <hr>
        <div class="text-lg-left">
        <p>There are a number of ways that you are being tracked online while
        surfing the web.  For now, we will talk about 2 of the main methods used to
        track and gather information about.</p>


            <h4><i><u>Cookies</u></i></h4>
            <p>Cookies are arguably the most common tools used in collecting our data.
            They are not the kind of cookies you would find in your bakery, instead these
            can be found in your computer(s) in the form of tiny files.  How did they get there?
            When you visit a website, some sites may place these cookies into your computer to allegedly
            better user experience.  There are 2 basic types of cookies:</p>
            <p><i>Session Cookies:</i></p>
            <p>- These are generally beneficial to user experience, as they allow you to go
            to different pages of a website without having to re-enter login info for example.
            As the name would suggest, session cookies are only stored on your computer for
            as long as your session on that given website, so as to say that they should be
            automatically deleted once you log off a website.</p>
            <p><i>Persistent Cookies:</i></p>
            <p>- These cookies on the other hand are as you could guess, much more
            persistent, being as they stay in your computer even if you were to leave
            a website.  These cookies keep track of the sites you visit and the searches
            you might make.  So for example, if one day you find yourself searching for a
            new car, you will begin seeing ads for cars everywhere you go, regardless if it's
            a completely different website or session.  </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-lg-left">
            <h4><i><u>Browser Fingerprinting</u></i></h4>
            <p>The second method, known as Browser Fingerprinting, is one a website
            saves a unique ID profile of you which holds a variety of info, such as
            installed extensions, browser types/names, time zones, screen resolution,
            adblock presence, computer hardware, and even more.  This is all done
            through websites sending snippets of Javascript code to your browser,
            which is then executed on whatever device you're browsing on.  This
            profile of you can then be saved for the next time you enter the website,
            or even shared amongst several websites.  Browser Fingerprinting is also
            known as the "cookie-less monsters" because it eliminates the need for
            cookies on some websites.  </p>
